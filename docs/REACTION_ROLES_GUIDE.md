# Super Simple Reaction Roles Setup

## One Command Setup! 🎉

Just run this **single command** and you're done:

```
!setup_reaction_roles
```

## What This Does Automatically:

1. **Creates 5 Skateboarding Roles** (if they don't exist):
   - 🏂 **Street Skater** (Red) - For street skating and technical tricks
   - 🏔️ **Vert Skater** (Blue) - For bowls and halfpipes  
   - 🌊 **Longboarder** (Green) - For cruising and carving
   - 🎥 **Filmer** (Yellow) - For those behind the camera
   - 🛠️ **Board Builder** (Magenta) - For DIY skateboard crafters

2. **Creates Beautiful Reaction Message** - With descriptions and emojis

3. **Links Everything Together** - All emojis automatically work with their roles

4. **Ready to Use** - Members can immediately start reacting!

## How Members Use It:

- **Add Reaction** = Get the role
- **Remove Reaction** = Lose the role

That's it! No complicated setup, no message IDs to copy, no manual linking required.

## Requirements:

- You need **Manage Roles** permission to run `!setup_reaction_roles`
- The bot needs **Manage Roles** permission  
- The bot's role must be higher than the roles it creates

## Troubleshooting:

- **Permission denied?** Make sure you have "Manage Roles" permission
- **Bot can't assign roles?** Move the bot's role higher in the server settings
- **Want to start over?** Use `!reset_reaction_roles` to clear everything

## That's It! 

One command = Full reaction roles system! 🛹
